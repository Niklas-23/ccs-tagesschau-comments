# Introduction

With the advent of Covid 19, the right-wing populist conspiracy discourse gained further momentum and social media
attention
to these topics increased. This new movement is usually referred to as the lateral thinking movement
(Querdenker-Bewegung) and unites
anti-vaccinationists, esotericists, conspiracy theorists and right-wingers in one group {cite:p}`muller_extrem_2022`.
But also people who have had little political involvement are part of this new movement {cite:p}`muller_extrem_2022`.
One reason why this movement has grown so much in recent years are social networks. These make it possible for the
different groups to connect with each other, which makes the continuous and widespread
dissemination of false information and fake news. They use social media platforms to share and spread their worldview
{cite:p}`muller_extrem_2022`.
The main social media platform for communication of this movement is Telegram and there
has also been a lot of coverage in the media about how this movement is using the platform for themselves
{cite:p}`muller_extrem_2022`. The main reason for this is
the lack of content moderation on Telegram, which allows the sharing of such content without restrictions, and the
privacy-friendly encryption of chats {cite:p}`muller_extrem_2022`. But Telegram is not the only social media platform
that is widely used by the lateral thinking movement. The comments and opinions of this group have also become more and
more present on other social media platforms.

One of the social media platforms which is also frequently used is YouTube {cite:p}`rauchfleisch_german_2020,reichardt2021corona`. 
If one looks at the comments under the videos of the "tagesschau" channel, one can get the impression that these
comments often belong to this discourse and do not necessarily always fit the content of the video. The aim of this
project report is therefore to find out to what extent this assumption is correct and whether the comments section
under the videos of the "tagesschau" channel is really dominated by the lateral thinking movement. In order to achieve
this, we will try to find answers to the following questions:

- Which topics are dominant in the comments section below the videos?
- How many comments can be attributed to the lateral thinking movement?
- Do the comments of lateral thinkers make up the majority of all comments?
- How dominant are right-wing comments?
- What is the general sentiment in the comments section?

The "tagesschau" channel was chosen because the comments were striking on the one hand and on the other hand because it
is a channel from one of the public broadcasters. For the lateral thinking movement, the public broadcasters are a kind
of symbol of the mainstream media and are often criticised for this reason {cite:p}`holzer_zwischen_2021,reichardt2021corona`. 
As politics is often the focus of
criticism by the lateral thinkers, the public broadcasters are particularly polarising. Another example of
polarisation are the so-called defectors, i.e. people who previously worked for the mainstream media, because they get a
lot of attention and support from the movement {cite:p}`reichardt2021corona`. In some cases, the mainstream
media are even accused of deliberately spreading false information {cite:p}`holzer_zwischen_2021,reichardt2021corona`.

## YouTube

YouTube is a widely-used social media platform that was launched in 2005 {cite:p}`ruby_youtube_2023`. It quickly became
one of
the most popular websites in the world with over 2 billion active users {cite:p}`ruby_youtube_2023`. The
platform allows anyone to upload videos and share them with a global audience, making it an important tool for
communication and self-expression {cite:p}`rauchfleisch_german_2020`. It is also a powerful tool for entertainment, with
users able to access music, movie trailers, and other forms of content.

YouTube has become a major source of information for many people, with users turning to the platform for news,
education, and political content. It is especially powerful in its ability to reach younger generations and those who
are not reached by traditional forms of media {cite:p}`rauchfleisch_german_2020`. However, despite its significance,
YouTube has been understudied in
political studies {cite:p}`rauchfleisch_german_2020`. The platform's role in shaping public opinion, spreading political
information and how it influences political campaigns is an area of ongoing research.

Additionally, YouTube is also a powerful tool for political campaigns and organizing. Many political figures and parties
have their own YouTube channels, and use the platform to disseminate information and engage with their supporters.
YouTube's ability to target specific audiences and measure the success of campaigns make it an important tool for
political organizations.

In summary, YouTube is an influential social media platform with a wide-ranging impact on society, culture, and
politics. For these reasons, it is also used by the lateral thinking movement to disseminate their content and many
supporters of the movement are active on the platform {cite:p}`rauchfleisch_german_2020`.

## Lateral thinking movement on YouTube

YouTube is an important platform for the lateral thinking movement, if not the second most important after Telegram, as
Holzer
has shown in a study of the communication of the lateral thinking movement {cite:p}`holzer_zwischen_2021`. This
observation is
particularly interesting because many channels that can be attributed to this movement have already been blocked by
YouTube {cite:p}`holzer_zwischen_2021`.
Nevertheless, the Telegram channels often link to YouTube videos {cite:p}`holzer_zwischen_2021`. One possible reason for
this
could be that
YouTube, in contrast to other social media platforms, offers the possibility of distributing video content that is
similar in format to classic media.
